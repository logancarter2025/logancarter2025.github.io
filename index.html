					<h3> ABOUT LOGAN CARTER</h3>
					<p>
						<span class="tab"></span>
						Hi! My name is Logan Carter and I'm from Southborough, Massachusetts. 
						I am a junior at RPI with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
						I have had a passion for computer programming since middle school and, in high school,
						I took AP Computer Science and several post-AP CS courses.
						After graduating high school in 2019, I moved to Barcelona, Spain, where I became TEFL certified and 
						taught English during a gap year. In college, I enjoyed my theoretical math classes so much that I
						declared a second major in Mathematics. I became involved on campus by being elected Class Vice President,
						joining a fraternity, and participating in club sports. 
						<br><span class="tab"></span> 
						Outside of school, I attended coding camps in middle and high school where I learned Swift and 
						App Development. During my junior and senior years of high school, 
						I mentored middle school boys in an extracurricular club, CS Gents. Later, after my first year of college, I worked as a remote summer intern for Sapphire Software Services. For my first project, I redesigned a help-guides webpage, and wrote a search and sorting algorithm in C# to create a search bar. Also during my time there, I worked on Panoramix, a tool for financial advisors. I programmed back-end functions to goal-track retirement progress for clients. More recently, during the summer of 2022, I worked as an intern in-office in Manhattan at TandemAI. There, I was responsible for building storage-performance tests on their HPC cluster, using python scripts to automate flexible I/O tester calls. I became familiar with terminal, HPC clusters, and an in-office work environment. 

						<br><span class="tab"></span>In my free time, I also enjoy traveling, playing soccer, basketball, and chess.

						<span class="tab"></span>I created a function to automatically run hundreds of fio storage tests on an HPC Cluster with varying latencies, block-sizes, throughput sizes, test file sizes, and alternated between random and sequential read and write tests. The function wrote the test results to a text file, and then read and graphed the results from the text file using matplotlib.

						<h4>Union College Sports History Analysis</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>I created a python function to automatically read through every Union College newspapers from 1880 to 2000. From here, I count the mention of certain sports in the newspapers, and analyze and graph the lexical density of each sport. From the sentences which mention sports, I measure the average sentence-level polarity, which is used to decide whether a sentence is negative or positive. I compare my findings with the actual results of the Union sports teams during these years.
