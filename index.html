					<h4><strong>RPI Computer Science Department</strong> --- Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h4> <h6><br><i>Troy, NY</i> (August 2022 - Present)</h6>

					<p>
						In my role as a graduate Teaching Assistant, I was entrusted with leading weekly laboratory sessions, where I imparted essential Python programming principles to a diverse cohort of thirty students. These sessions, carefully structured to ensure both practical and theoretical learning, were critical in fostering their computational thinking abilities. To provide tailored support and address individual queries, I maintained flexible drop-in office hours. This not only assisted students with their homework and coursework but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject. Furthermore, I administered critical academic responsibilities, including grading exams and assignments, thus allowing me to monitor students' progress closely. I also diligently improved course materials, ensuring they were up-to-date and effective, and thus contributed to a more comprehensive learning environment.

						<h4>Graph Abstract Data Type and Applications</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>I have successfully implemented a robust Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a graph, reinforcing the core data structure with fundamental graph algorithms that include graph traversal, shortest path calculations, and the production of minimal spanning trees. The implementation of the graph traversal algorithms allows efficient exploration of all the vertices and edges of the graph, ensuring that every entry is examined for further operations. Furthermore, the shortest path algorithms were put in place, catering to the essential need for determining the least-cost path between two nodes. This becomes particularly significant in scenarios demanding cost or time optimization. Lastly, the provision for producing minimal spanning trees in the graph ADT becomes a powerful tool in network design, as it minimizes the total cost or distance while connecting all vertices, demonstrating a pragmatic and optimal approach towards problem-solving. This comprehensive implementation of graph ADT demonstrates a firm grasp of data structures and algorithms, and their applications in real-world situations.

						<h4>CPU Process Manager</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>As part of a collaborative team, I contributed significantly to the design of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) Process Simulation, culminating in the development of four distinct scheduling models. These models were meticulously created to replicate and study the functioning of real-world CPU scheduling algorithms, thus enhancing our understanding and ability to improve computational efficiency. To enable a realistic and effective examination of task performance, we created a simulated environment. This simulation mimicked the conditions and constraints found in actual CPU processing environments, thereby providing valuable insights into the dynamics of task scheduling and management. We leveraged the utility of GitHub as our primary platform for code organization and task delegation, reinforcing our teamwork while ensuring an organized and efficient workflow. GitHub's version control features were instrumental in tracking progress, maintaining multiple iterations, and enabling seamless collaboration. The project required a thorough understanding of operating system concepts, the ability to design effective simulations, and the skill to work as a part of a cohesive team, all of which we demonstrated successfully.

						<h4>Matrix Algebra Library</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>
						I meticulously designed a comprehensive Matrix Library, applying the principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), which exhibits the ability to perform a variety of matrix operations. This development project was conceived with a focus on extending support to multiple matrix manipulations, thus providing a robust tool for numerical computation and algebraic operations. The library enables a multitude of actions on matrices, including but not limited to, matrix multiplication, inversion, and determinant calculation. For instance, the multiplication feature supports both scalar and matrix multiplication, enhancing the versatility of the library. The inversion operation is equipped to handle square matrices and employ algorithms to ensure computational efficiency. Moreover, the capability to calculate the determinant aids in understanding the unique properties of a matrix and serves as a crucial function in many mathematical, scientific, and engineering calculations. The design and development of this Matrix Library underscores not only my technical proficiency in object-oriented programming but also my understanding of complex mathematical constructs.

						<h4>Game Engine Artificial Intelligence</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>In the field of game development, I have had the opportunity to work on a project involving the use of predictive behavioral patterns to strategize optimal moves in various two-player games, including checkers and Connect 4. This initiative represents the epitome of intersection between psychology and technology, employing human behavioral patterns to anticipate potential moves and outcomes. The central thrust of this project was algorithmic design, a critical skill in modern computer science, which I leveraged to simulate and predict player moves. In doing so, we were able to establish a range of likely actions a player might take given their current position and state in the game. The system was intricately designed to understand and emulate player behavior, helping it make strategically sound moves while also reacting adaptively to a player's actions.
