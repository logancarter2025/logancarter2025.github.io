					<h4><strong>RPI Computer Science Department</strong> --- Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h4> <h6><br><i>Troy, NY</i> (August 2022 - May 2023)</h6>

					<p>
						In my role as a Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, I was entrusted with leading weekly laboratory sessions, where I instilled essential Python programming principles to a diverse class of thirty students. These sessions, carefully structured to ensure both practical and theoretical learning, were critical in fostering their computational thinking abilities. To provide tailored support and address individual queries, I maintained flexible drop-in office hours. This not only assisted students with their homework and coursework but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject. Furthermore, I administered critical academic responsibilities, including grading exams and assignments, thus allowing me to monitor students' progress closely. I also diligently improved course materials, ensuring they were up-to-date and effective, which contributed to a more comprehensive learning environment.

					<h4><strong">Roche Bros. Supermarket</strong> --- Grocery Clerk and Cashier</h4><h6><br><i>Westboro, MA</i> (April 2017 - August 2021)</h6>
					<p>
						As an efficient grocery clerk, I ensured items were accurately stocked and organized following the store's planogram. My responsibilities included unloading and inspecting deliveries from trucks, carefully verifying product details for precise inventory management. High standards were upheld for cleanliness and orderliness on the shelves and in store aisles, thereby fostering a safe and inviting shopping atmosphere for customers. Regularly, I carried out shelf rotation duties to maintain product freshness, promptly identifying and removing expired or damaged goods. Equipped with a comprehensive knowledge of the store's layout and product locations, exceptional customer service was provided by assisting customers in locating items and responding to their product queries. As a cooperative team member, I collaborated with my peers to complete tasks and meet store targets, highlighting my strong teamwork and communication skills. As a cashier, I was skilled in operating registers and handled 15-20 transactions per hour. I resolved conflicts and issues using outstanding customer service skills.

						<h4>Graph Abstract Data Type and Applications</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>I have successfully implemented a robust Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a graph, reinforcing the core data structure with fundamental graph algorithms that include graph traversal, shortest path calculations, and the production of minimal spanning trees. The implementation of the graph allows for efficient traversal of all the nodes and edges of the graph, ensuring that every entry is examined for further operations. Furthermore, the shortest path algorithm was implemented using Dijkstra’s algorithm, allowing for optimal runtime for determining the least-cost path between any two nodes. This becomes particularly significant in scenarios demanding cost or time optimization. Lastly, the implementation for producing minimal spanning trees in the graph ADT can be used as a powerful tool in network design, as it minimizes the total cost or distance while connecting all vertices, demonstrating an advantageous approach towards problem solving. This comprehensive implementation of a graph ADT demonstrates a firm grasp of data structures and algorithms, emphasizing their practical relevance.

						<h4>CPU Process Manager</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>
						As part of a collaborative team, I contributed to the design of a central processing unit (CPU) process simulation, culminating in the development of four distinct scheduling models. These models were created to replicate and analyze the functioning of real-world CPU scheduling algorithms, thus enhancing my understanding and ability to interpret computational efficiency. To enable a realistic and effective examination of task performance, we created a simulated environment. This simulation mimicked the conditions and constraints found in actual CPU processing environments, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of task scheduling and management. We used GitHub as our primary platform for code organization and task delegation, reinforcing our teamwork while ensuring an organized and efficient workflow. The project required a thorough understanding of operating system concepts, the ability to design effective simulations, and the skill to work as a part of a cohesive team.

						<h4>Matrix Algebra Library</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>
						I designed a comprehensive matrix library, applying the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows the ability to perform a variety of matrix operations. This development project was conceived with a focus on extending support to multiple matrix manipulations, thus providing a robust tool for numerical computation and algebraic operations. The library enables a multitude of matrix operations, including but not limited to: matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, and determinant calculation. The design and development of this matrix library not only displays my technical proficiency in object-oriented programming but also my understanding of complex mathematical constructs.

						<h4>Game Engine Artificial Intelligence</h4>
						<span class="tab"></span>Taking an interest in artificial intelligence, I decided to develop an AI that plays the user in various two-player games. Currently it supports checkers, Connect 4, and tic-tac-toe, but given the modular and well-structured code I've employed, the AI can easily be extended to support additional games. This project's core focus was on algorithmic design, a critical skill in modern computer science, which I leveraged to simulate and predict player moves, allowing the best response from the computer.
